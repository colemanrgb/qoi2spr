In this directory are the source files for building the different programmes for converting QOI to Sprite and vice versa.

They are designed for use with ObjAsm and the Linker from the DDE.


There are 4 Obey files which do the work of compiling the sources into the relevant programme.
They are all intended to be run from a TaskWindow with the current directory set to the Source directory.

1. CompileApp creates the !RunImage, AssemCode and Lib_Wimp files inside !Qoi2Spr.
   The AssemCode file is created from s.(App).!App which loads and assembles the other files.
2. CompileModule creates the RISC OS 4 Image File Converter module ConvertQOI, controlled by s.(Module).!Module.
3. CompilePD creates the PhotoDesk format handler file !3QOI.Handler, controlled by s.(PhotoDesk).!Handler.
4. CompileTransQOI creates the !Convert, AssemCode and Messages2 files for !TransQOI.
   The AssemCode file is created from s.(App).!App which loads and assembles the other files.
   The Messages2 file is a copy of the Messages file in !Qoi2Spr and the message lines which are pertinent only to !Qoi2Spr need to be removed manually.


s.VersionASM contains the version information for the Assembly files, and s.VersionBas has the same for the BASIC files.


BJoin is used to combine the various BASIC files into a single BASIC file.
BASSwitch is then used to remove lines that aren't required (eg debugging code), depending on the variables set in the system variable <Qoi2Spr$Debug>.

To turn debugging on and off with the BASIC files, set DEBUG=TRUE or DEBUG=FALSE, as appropriate, in <Qoi2Spr$Debug> within the CompileApp and CompileTransQOI files.

Debugging code has been removed from the Assembly files.

The debugging routines use Reporter (v2.66 or later) so you need to make sure it is loaded before running any of the programmes if debugging is turned on.
