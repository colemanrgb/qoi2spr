ABOUT

BASSwitch is a utility which allows processing of tokenised BASIC programs
from one location to another, removing sections as dictated by conditions in
the program being processed.

COMMAND LINE SYNTAX

  *BASSwitch <input> <output> [-Switches <switches>] [-Remove]

  where

  <input>    is the input filename of the tokenised BASIC source program
  <output>   is the filename of the tokenised BASIC destination program
  <switches> is a list of variables to define for use in program conditions
  -Remove    will strip any conditions found in the destination program

The list of switches is used by BASSwitch to create some BASIC variables with
specified values. These can then be referenced by conditions in the source
program.

PROGRAM SYNTAX

  REM #if <expression>

  If the BASIC expression, <expression>, evaluates to any non-zero value, the
  code between this condition and the next will be dumped to the output file.
  If it evaluates to zero, this code will not be dumped.

  REM #else

  The else condition is optional. If the expression evaluated to zero, the
  code between this and the next condition will be dumped.

  REM #end

  The end condition marks the end of a conditional block of code.

Conditional blocks can be nested up to ten levels deep. The REM must be the
first statement on a line. It may have leading and trailing spaces.


EXAMPLE

Given the command line:

  *BASSwitch !RunImage/src !RunImage -s "DEBUG=TRUE machine$=""Iyonix"""

and the !RunImage/src file containing:

  10 REM #if DEBUG
  20 PRINT " This is a debug build "
  30 REM #if machine$="Iyonix"
  40 PRINT " for Iyonix machines only "
  50 REM #else
  60 PRINT " for non-Iyonix machines "
  70 REM #end
  80 REM #else
  90 PRINT " This is a non-debug build "
 100 REM #end

a !RunImage file will be produced containing:

  10 REM #if DEBUG
  20 PRINT " This is a debug build "
  30 REM #if machine$="Iyonix"
  40 PRINT " for Iyonix machines only "
  50 REM #else
  70 REM #end
  80 REM #else
 100 REM #end

However, if the -Remove parameter is also passed to BASSwitch, !RunImage will
contain the following:

  20 PRINT " This is a debug build "
  40 PRINT " for Iyonix machines only "
