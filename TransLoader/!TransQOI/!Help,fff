===============================================================================

Written in BASIC and Assembler, !TransQOI allows conversion of images in the new
"QOI" format to RISC OS Sprite for applications which make use of Computer
Concepts' FFG protocol, such as Ovation Pro and PrivateEye.

The QOI filetype (&A61) has been allocated by ROOL.

The Quite OK Image (QOI) format, invented by Dominic Szablewski, is designed for
fast, lossless image compression. The specification, reference code and example
images can be found at https://qoiformat.org/

This application conforms to version 1.0 2022-01-05 of the QOI specification.


INSTALLATION
===============================================================================

Copy the application "!TransQOI" into a suitable directory such as !OvnPro.AutoRun

To set the filetype of a QOI file downloaded from the Internet or from a Windows
PC, add the following to your Mimemap file:
    image/x-qoi		QOI		a61	.qoi


OPTIONS
===============================================================================

Options which can be specified in TransLoader$Tail in the !Run file:
  -da <N>        Use a Dynamic Area instead of Wimpslot. <N> is max size of
				 Dynamic Area in Mb
  -mask1         Create a RISC OS 3.5 Sprite with a 1bpp mask
  -mask8         Create a RISC OS 3.5 Sprite with an 8bpp alpha mask.
                 Overrides -mask1
  -alpha         Create a RISC OS 5 Sprite with an alpha channel instead of a
                 mask. Overrides -mask1 and -mask8
  -clean         With -mask1 or -mask8 will remove mask if all bits of the mask
                 are solid. With -alpha will only use alpha channel if the QOI
                 has 4 channels
  -autoOpts      Set the mask and alpha channel options according to the number
                 of channels in the QOI file. Overrides -mask1, -mask8, -alpha
                 and -clean. Can be shortened to -auto
  -ex <N>        Specify the X eigen value in <N> (where <N> is 0-3 or 180,
				 90, 45, 22). Defaults to 1 (90 DPI)
  -ey <N>        Specify the Y eigen value in <N> (where <N> is 0-3 or 180,
				 90, 45, 22). Defaults to 1 (90 DPI)


The mask and alpha parameters are set depending on which version of RISC OS it
is being run on:
  * Prior to RISC OS 5 a 1bpp mask is used
  * For RISC OS 6 an 8bpp alpha mask is used
  * For RISC OS 5 an alpha channel is used

The -clean parameter is also set so that if all the bits of the mask are solid,
then the mask will be removed. And if -alpha is specified then an alpha channel
will only be used if the QOI file being converted has 4 channels.

This can be changed by altering TransLoader$Tail in the !Run file.

Pressing Escape will abandon the loading of the QOI file.


MEMORY
===============================================================================

By default memory to hold the Sprite and the QOI file is taken from the
application's Wimpslot, which is limited to 28Mb on non-RISC OS 5 systems (and
on RISC OS 5 if Aemulor is active), or 512Mb on RISC OS 5.

Using a Dynamic Area is recommended for non-RISC OS 5 systems.

To use a Dynamic Area specify the -da parameter, followed by a non-zero positive
number to specify the maximum size of the Dynamic Area in MB, eg: -da 64, to
claim a maximum of 64MB. Memory is only claimed when loading the file to be
converted and when the actual conversion takes place, and is released as soon as
the conversion is complete. And so depending on what else you have running you
might not be able to claim all that memory.

The Dynamic Area is called "QOI 2 Sprite Heap".

Prior to RISC OS 3.80 applications could set the maximum size of the Dynamic
Area to the amount of memory in the machine. From RISC OS 3.80 clamps were set
on the maximum size of a Dynamic Area to prevent applications trying to use all
the memory. The default value is 128MB.

Qoi2Spr will try and take as much memory as it can to do the conversion, using
up to 3 cache buffers. You can restrict the amount of memory used by each cache
buffer by setting the System Variable (Number) <Qoi2Spr$MaxCacheSize> to the
value, in bytes, to be used; for example, to restrict each cache buffer to
100Mb use:
    SetEval Qoi2Spr$MaxCacheSize 100*1024*1024
would force Qoi2Spr to only use up to 300Mb in total.
The minimum amount that can be specified is 64Kb for each cache buffer.


LIMITATIONS
===============================================================================

* !TransQOI can't read files larger than 2Gb.

* !TransQOI only converts from QOI to Sprite.

* On an error all that is reported is the message "File could not be converted".
  This is a limitation of the !Server application. The reason for the error is
  stored in the system variable <TransQOI$Failure>.
